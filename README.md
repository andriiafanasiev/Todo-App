To add a screenshot to your README, you can follow these steps:

1. **Take a screenshot of your Todo app** while it's running in the browser.
2. **Save the screenshot** in your project folder, preferably in a directory like `assets/images/`.

3. **Add the image to the README** by referencing its relative path.

Here's how your updated README could look with the screenshot:

---
